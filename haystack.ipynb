It is also noteworthy that the appearance of Winterfell has changed over the seasons: in Seasons 3 and 4 Winterfell was covered in smoke, referencing its burning at the end of Season 2, and in Season 5 the smoke was removed but the Bolton sigil replaced the Stark sigil, reflecting how the Boltons moved to Winterfell during that season. In episode 6.10, the Stark sigil returned, the result of Jon Snow and Sansa Stark's reclaiming Winterfell from the Boltons at the end of the previous episode.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 8}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '55f7f13db2cd3b84de3b3ce2d0d0b776'}>,\n",

He is set to appear in the forthcoming novel ''The Winds of Winter''. Littlefinger's primary character attributes are his cunning and boundless ambition. Originally hailing from a minor family with little wealth or influence, Baelish used manipulation, bribery, and the connections he secured at Riverrun to gain power and prestige in King's Landing. Since then, his various intrigues have directly caused several major events that have impacted Westeros, including the framing of Tyrion Lannister for the attempt on Bran Stark's life, the downfall of Lord Eddard Stark, the deaths of Lord Jon Arryn and King Joffrey Baratheon, and the War of the Five Kings.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '186f29e83a7d51855aa4cfded4f33355'}>,\n",

One of them was the 15th century historical event known as the \"Black Dinner\", where the Scottish king invited the chieftains of the powerful Clan Douglas to a feast at Edinburgh Castle.

In 2012, at ComicCon he even joked that \"he will visit a country with no television when the episode goes on air\".\\n\\nMartin also said he killed off Robb because he believed the audience would assume that the story was about Ned Stark\\'s heir avenging his death and wished to keep them guessing.

Another aspect that was mentioned as an improvement was the treatment of the romantic relationships.\\n\\nMany reviews signaled the lack of focus as the main flaw of the episode, although they agreed that the story required preparing the stage for the final part of the season: Emily VanDerWerff wrote at \\'\\'The A.V.

Other scenes that were highlighted were the parley between Daenerys and the slaver, and the confrontation between Tywin and Joffrey. In the latter, the camera work used by director Michelle MacLaren was lauded.\\n\\nIn contrast, the scene featuring Theon\\'s torture was criticized for what was seen as its gratuitous violence and nudity, and for the repetitiveness of the storyline over the season.

The writers also included original storylines including Theon\\'s flight, Tyrion bringing Podrick to a brothel, and Melisandre departing Dragonstone.\\n\\nIn the scene at the brothel, Tyrion claims that the last prostitute he introduces is one of the few women in the world able to perform \"the Meereenese Knot\". This is an inside joke referring to the name that Martin gave (after the legendary Gordian Knot) to a complicated structural problem that he had to face while writing the fifth book of the series, \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\'. This book had to synchronize the arrival of several characters in the city of Meereen while keeping the chronology and causations in line and informing the reader of events happening in places where no point-of-view character was present. Martin worked on solving \"the Meereenese Knot\" from 2005 to 2011, and it was one of the main causes behind the late delivery of the book.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 3}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e1d01b7b4eeec4ccb2a98df6c88c13d9'}>,\n",

At the request of his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister, Joffrey spends a portion of the tourney with Sansa, but near the end he commands his guard Sandor Clegane, better known as The Hound, to take her back to her quarters. Sandor explains how his older brother, Gregor, aka \"Mountain that Rides\" pushed his face into a brazier of hot coals, for playing with one of his wooden toys.\\n\\nAfter Eddard discovers the truth of Joffrey\\'s paternity, he tells Sansa that they will be heading back to Winterfell. Sansa is devastated and wishes to stay in King\\'s Landing, so she runs off to inform Queen Cersei of her father\\'s plans, unwittingly providing Cersei with the information needed to arrest her father.
